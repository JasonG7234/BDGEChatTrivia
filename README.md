# BDGE Chat Trivia

This is a very barebones project scaffolding for a Python project. Feel free to fork & modify as you wish.

Note: I would also recommend creating a virtual environment to go along with this project, but it is currently ignored according to the .gitignore.

## Usage

`$ python main.py`
