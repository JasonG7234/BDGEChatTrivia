# BDGE Chat Trivia

This is a very basic chat trivia implementation for BDGE. This supports YouTube or Twitch integrations. It relies on a file `messages.csv` to update and output new changes to the file.

Note: I would also recommend creating a virtual environment to go along with this project, but it is currently ignored according to the .gitignore.

## Usage

`$ python src/tw_template.py`

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## TODO

Needs to be load tested on a larger scale. Might be a better way to do than update a file.
Need to pigeonhole good fuzzy match value. 
Needs to have CLEAR/RESTART functionality.
